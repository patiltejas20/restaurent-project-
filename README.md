## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user is shown a list of available menu items with prices.
2. The user enters the name of the food item they want to order.
3. If the item exists in the menu, it is added to the order and the cost is added to the total.
4. The user is asked if they want to add another item:

   * If **Yes**, the menu is displayed again with the current total.
   * If **No**, the program displays the final bill summary.
5. The total payable amount is displayed at the end.
